# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz
My motivation for this project is to create a quiz for bootcamp students to test their knowledge and guage the progress along the course.

I would like a system that has 5 questions and a timer of 60 seconds. Once this timer reaches 0 the quiz will end. If the student selects the wrong answer then 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.

Having this system will display the top 5 highest scores and the students initials which will help guage their progress compared to other stdents on the bootcamp.

During this project I was able to practice event listeners, setting API's, timer functions  and JSON functions. I also learned about the arrow function to write shorter function syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

For this project I watched a video where a developer made a quiz which I learnt a lot from. I was able to watch the video and adapt elements to suit the design I wanted for my own quiz. The quiz created during this video was quite different to my own and did not include a timer however it was a great support when storing the highest scores in the local storage as I struggled with this part of the project. https://www.jamesqquick.com/courses/build-a-quiz-app-with-html-css-and-javascript/
